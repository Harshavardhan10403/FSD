    <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle) in 1995. It's known for its "write once, run anywhere" capability, meaning Java code can be executed on any device or operating system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. Java is a versatile language used in diverse applications, including web development, mobile apps (like Android), desktop software, and enterprise systems. </p>

    <p>A framework provides a structured foundation for building software applications. It offers a pre-defined structure and reusable components, allowing developers to avoid starting from scratch and accelerating the development process. Frameworks are typically associated with a specific programming language and are tailored for different types of applications, such as web development, mobile app development, and data science. </p>
